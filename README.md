# Thoughts  
This is a page where I upload random thoughts about stuff that annoys me or whatever.  

* Uploading testing plugins onto spigotmc  
  I see this so often and I dont understand, what benift does this have to anyone at all?  
  Why do they feel the need to.
  Picture of what I mean:

* The medical system in the UK:  
  Picture this, you are fat. You eat too much crap and dont do exercise, your fault. Because of your size your knees hurt and you go to a NHS hostpital, have maybe even have an operation on your knee. That cost the NHS alot of money, for something you could have prevented.  
  Now picture this. You were born and in your genes, your eyesight isnt the greatest, espescially in your older years. Not something you can control. Yes, when you are a child you can get some free glasses... but what about when you are older... you have to pay. And pay alot.   
  Conclusion:  
  You dont have to pay for help with something you have control over (your weight), but you do have to pay for help with your eyesight, which is something you mostly not control. Seems scuffed, right?
